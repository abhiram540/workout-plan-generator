Build a Workout Plan Generator



Objective:
Build a single-page Streamlit app that takes structured inputs about a user's fitness goals and
generates a personalized workout plan using an LLM via the Groq API. This project isn't about
wiring up an API call, it's about designing inputs that give the LLM enough context to produce
something a real person could actually follow.



The Use Case:
A user should be able to open the app, tell it about themselves, and get back a usable weekly workout
plan not a generic “do some squats” response. Think about what a personal trainer would actually
ask before writing a plan for someone.



What to Build:

1. Structured inputs (not just one text box)
At minimum, collect:
• Fitness goal (dropdown: Build muscle / Lose fat / General fitness / Improve endurance)
• Experience level (dropdown: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
• Days available per week (slider or number input, e.g. 1–7)
• Equipment access (dropdown or multiselect: No equipment / Home dumbbells / Full gym)
• Optional: injuries or limitations (free text — e.g. “bad knees”, “no overhead pressing”)
2. A “Generate Plan” button
Sends these inputs to the LLM and displays the result in a clearly formatted area (e.g. a weekly
breakdown, day by day).
3. A Python function with type hints
This function should:
• Take the structured inputs as parameters
• Build a well-designed prompt
• Call the Groq API and return the response
• Be wrapped in try/except
4. Basic error handling
• Missing/invalid inputs (e.g. 0 days selected) → friendly message, not a crash
• Failed API call (bad key, network issue, rate limit) → friendly message, not a crash
• Empty or malformed LLM response → friendly fallback message.



Prompt Design:

Don't just concatenate the inputs into a sentence and hope for the best. The prompt should push the

model to:
• Respect the constraints (equipment, injuries, days/week) not ignore them
• Return a structured output (e.g. Day 1 / Day 2... with exercises, sets, reps) rather than a wall of text
• Stay appropriately scoped — no medical claims, and add a small disclaimer when injury-related input is given



Tech Stack
• Python - functions with type hints, try/except
• Streamlit for the UI
• Groq for the LLM call



Stretch Goals (optional, not required)
• “Regenerate” button to get a different variation of the plan
• Store the last generated plan in st.session\_state so it persists across reruns
• Let the user download the plan as a .txt or .md file
• Add a “Swap this exercise” mini-feature for one exercise at a time



This project will be judged on the following criteria, so build accordingly.

|#|Criteria|Weight|
|-|-|-|
|1|App runs without crashing on empty or invalid input|20%|
|2|Inputs are structured (not just free text) and correctly passed into the prompt|25%|
|3|Prompt design plan respects constraints, is well-structured, and is genuinely usable|30%|
|4|Error handling (API failure, empty/malformed response)|15%|
|5|Code quality (type hints, function separation, readability)|10%|
